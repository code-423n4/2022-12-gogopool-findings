# `assets` should be immutable for optimization
Immutable variables are stored in the bytecode and are more cheaper than the storage ones, a variable instantiated as immutable would result in all proxies pointing to the same value stored in byte code, rather than the proxy pointing to the variable in in it's own storage.


*Proof of concept*

*Recommendation*

Change `asset` variable from `public` to `immutable`


# Short circuit the `onlyRegisteredNetworkContract()` modifier check 
Short-circuiting is a strategy we can make use of when an operation makes use of either || or &&. This pattern works by ordering the lower-cost operation first so that the higher-cost operation may be skipped (short-circuited) if the first operation evaluates to true.

*Proof of concept*

In this case, we are directly reading from the storage in the first operation, which is more expensive than any other != operation. 


*Recommendation*

Modifiy the code to this, 

```
	/// @dev Only allow access from guardian or the latest version of a contract in the GoGoPool network
	modifier onlyRegisteredNetworkContract() {
		if (msg.sender != guardian && booleanStorage[keccak256(abi.encodePacked("contract.exists", msg.sender))] == false) {
			revert InvalidOrOutdatedContract();
		}
		_;
	} 
```
