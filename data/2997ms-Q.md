## Low Risk Issues

### [LOW-01] Missing Checks for Address(0x0) </a>

Lack of zero-address validation on address parameters may lead to transaction reverts, waste gas, require resubmission of transactions and may even force contract redeployments in certain cases within the protocol.

**Proof Of Concept**
```
/// @dev Set the main GoGo Storage address
	constructor(Storage _gogoStorageAddress) {
		// Update the contract address
		gogoStorage = Storage(_gogoStorageAddress);
	}
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/Base.sol#L11


**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

Add the check of address != 0

### [LOW-02]Put the action of emit at the end of the functions
Now we emit ```TokenTransfer ``` no matter it gets succeed or not. After this emit, we may revert. So this metric is not accurate. We should put the emit action by the end of the whole function

**Proof Of Concept**

```
		// Emit transfer event
		emit AVAXTransfer(fromContractName, toContractName, amount);
		// Verify there are enough funds
		if (avaxBalances[fromContractName] < amount) {
			revert InsufficientContractBalance();
		}
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/Vault.sol#L92

```
		// Emit deposit event
		emit AVAXDeposited(contractName, msg.value);
		// Update balances
		avaxBalances[contractName] = avaxBalances[contractName] + msg.value;
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/Vault.sol#L54

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Put the emit action by the end of the whole function

## Non Critical Issues


### [NC-01]Lines are too long

Usually lines in source code are limited to 80 characters. Today’s screens are much larger so it’s reasonable to stretch this in some cases. Since the files will most likely reside in GitHub, and GitHub starts using a scroll bar in all cases when the length is over 164 characters, the lines below should be split when they reach that length.

Reference:
[https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/style-guide.html#maximum-line-length](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/style-guide.html#maximum-line-length)


**Proof Of Concept**

```

		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".avaxNodeOpRewardAmt")), avaxNodeOpRewardAmt);
		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("minipool.item", minipoolIndex, ".avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt")), avaxLiquidStakerRewardAmt);
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L420

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Follow the recommended solidity doc and reduce the lengths of codes.


### [NC-02]Public Functions Not Called By The Contract Should Be Declared External Instead

If a functions not called by the contract, we should be declare it external instead


**Proof Of Concept**


```
function getAVAXStake(address stakerAddr) public view returns (uint256) 
function getTotalGGPStake() public view returns (uint256) {
    
    
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/Staking.sol#L66
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/Staking.sol#L103
**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Change them from ```public``` to  ```external```


### [NC-03]Non-usage of specific imports

The current form of relative path import is not recommended for use because it can unpredictably pollute the namespace.
Instead, the Solidity docs recommend specifying imported symbols explicitly.
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/layout-of-source-files.html#importing-other-source-files

**Proof Of Concept**

```
import {MinipoolManager} from "./MinipoolManager.sol";
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/Staking.sol#L5


**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

Use specific imports syntax per solidity docs recommendation.




###  [NC-04]Open TODOs

An open TODO is present. It is recommended to avoid open TODOs as they may indicate programming errors that still need to be fixed.

**Proof Of Concept**

```
// TODO Revisit this logic if we ever allow unequal matched funds
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L412


```
// TODO cant use onlySpecificRegisteredContract("ClaimNodeOp", msg.sender) since we also call from increaseMinipoolCount. Wat do?
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/Staking.sol#L203

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Resolve these TODOs

### [NC-05]Solidity versions should be consistent

Most of solidity versions in the files are ```pragma solidity 0.8.17;```, but in ```ERC20Upgradeable.sol``` and ```ERC4626Upgradeable.sol```
, the value is ```pragma solidity >=0.8.0;```

**Proof Of Concept**
```
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC20Upgradeable.sol#L2

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/tokens/upgradeable/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Make the versions consistent

### [NC-06]Check the index before getting the minipool

Here we don't check the index and we just directly retrieve the value. If we add a validation of the index, it will help us save some gas.

**Proof Of Concept**
```
		int256 index = getIndexOf(nodeID);
		return getMinipool(index);
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/MinipoolManager.sol#L573

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Add the check that the index should be >= 0
