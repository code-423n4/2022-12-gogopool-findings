In ClaimProtocolDAO.sol `https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/ClaimProtocolDAO.sol`.

It seems that the vault.withdrawToken() function (in the spend() function) without any error checking. 
It means that if the vault.withdrawToken() function fails or returns an error for any reason, it is not handled by the spend() function. 

For example, if the vault.withdrawToken() function fails to transfer the token (GGP), the spend() function will not be able to detect the failure and will continue to execute as if the transfer was successful.
