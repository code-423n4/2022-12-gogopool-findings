1USE REQUIRE INSTEAD OF ASSERT

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L83

Assert should not be used except for tests, require should be used

Prior to Solidity 0.8.0, pressing a confirm consumes the remainder of the process’s available gas instead of returning it, as request()/revert() did.

Assertion() should be avoided even after solidity version 0.8.0, because its documentation states “The Assert function generates an error of type Panic(uint256). Code that works properly should never Panic, even on invalid external input. If this happens, you need to fix it in your contract. there’s a mistake”.

2 Unlocked pragma

Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.
