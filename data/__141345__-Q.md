#### `RewardsCycleTotalAmt` event not accurate

`RewardsCycleTotalAmt` event is emitted too early, and it will be updated after the emission in `inflate()`.
```solidity
File: contract/RewardsPool.sol
161: 		emit NewRewardsCycleStarted(getRewardsCycleTotalAmt());

99: 		setUint(keccak256("RewardsPool.RewardsCycleTotalAmt"), newTokens);
```

Suggestion:
emit the event after `inflate()` is called.


#### `RewardsCycleStartTime` will be delayed for every reward cycle.

Currently, the `RewardsCycleStartTime` is updated to the spot timestamp. 

```solidity
File: contract/RewardsPool.sol
164: 		setUint(keccak256("RewardsPool.RewardsCycleStartTime"), block.timestamp);
```

But each time `startRewardsCycle()` is called, there will be some small delay. which means each cycle, the `RewardsCycleStartTime` will be longer than 28 days compared with last time. Over time, the small delay will accumulate.

Suggestion:
round down the increase amount for `RewardsCycleStartTime` by multiple of `dao.getRewardsCycleSeconds()`.
