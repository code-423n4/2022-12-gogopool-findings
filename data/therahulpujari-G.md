On lines 156 and 157, there are uint256 variable declarations.
```
Line 156 and 157
uint256 rewardsAmount = 100 ether;
uint256 liquidStakerRewards = 50 ether - ((50 ether * 15) / 100);
```

Since both these variables hold only upto 100 ether, we can make them both into uint128 which can still hold the same amount of ether and weâ€™ll be able to save gas by using only one slot of uint128 + uint128 instead of 2 uint256 slots hence saving half the gas. 

The next finding is,
on line 188 of TokenggAVAX.t.sol, we see ```uint256 endTime = block.timestamp + mp.duration;```

This variable endTime is again used in line 191 ```minipoolMgr.recordStakingEnd{value: totalStakedAmount + rewardsAmount}(nodeID, endTime, rewardsAmount);```

Since the variable is being called only once, we can save gas by removing the specific uint256 declaration of endTime and directly mentioning  ```block.timestamp + mp.duration;```

This saves a whole memory slot that would otherwise be used to make the uint256 slot.

So, the end result would look something like this on line 191:

```minipoolMgr.recordStakingEnd{value: totalStakedAmount + rewardsAmount}(nodeID, block.timestamp + mp.duration, rewardsAmount);```

The next finding is on Line 152:

```
Line 152: 
uint256 depositAmount = 2000 ether;
uint256 stakingWithdrawAmount = 1000 ether;
uint256 totalStakedAmount = 2000 ether;
```

We have three variables here declaring the amount of ether they store. Note that depositAmount is used multiple times throughout the remainder of the code by stakingWithdrawAmount and totalStakedAmount are used 1 and 2 times, respectively.

So, for stakingWithdrawAmount, which is declared as 1000 ether, it can be directly addressed in the lines that used the variable. Hence on line 178, we can replace
```
assertEq(ggAVAX.stakingTotalAssets(), stakingWithdrawAmount); 
with just assertEq(ggAVAX.stakingTotalAssets(), 1000 ether);
```

Similarly, for the variable totalStakedAmount, on lines 176 and 191, we can replace the existing lines with:
```assertEq(address(rialto).balance, rialtoInitBal + 2000 ether)
minipoolMgr.recordStakingEnd{value: 2000 ether+ rewardsAmount}(nodeID, endTime, rewardsAmount);;```
