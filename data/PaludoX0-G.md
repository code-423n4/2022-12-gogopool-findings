## Usage of uints/ints smaller than 32 BYTES (256 BITS) incurs overhead

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract’s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. 
Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.  


## function withdrawAVAX() doesn't check if assets or shares are = 0

To avoid transferring of 0 avax input parameter should be checked


## Use unchecked {i++} since cycle for will never overflow
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MultisigManager.sol#L82

As stated in notes **"There will never be more than 10 total multisigs"** therefore total will not exceed 10.
You can use `unchecked {i++;}` to save gas at every iteration.

Moreover also at the following lines i++ can be used `unchecked {i++;}` because before going overflow iteration will most probably run out of gas.

## Unused internal function to be removed
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L255
`function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)` is not called by any contract, can be removed.
I'm aware that there are similar occurences in already known issues **[GAS-11] internal functions not called by the contract should be removed** but this function is not mentioned.
