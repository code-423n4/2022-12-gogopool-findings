## Usage of uints/ints smaller than 32 BYTES (256 BITS) incurs overhead

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. 
Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.  


## function withdrawAVAX() doesn't check if assets or shares are = 0

To avoid transferring of 0 avax input parameter should be checked


## Use unchecked {i++} since cycle for will never overflow
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/MultisigManager.sol#L82

As stated in notes **"There will never be more than 10 total multisigs"** therefore total will not exceed 10.
You can use `unchecked {i++;}` to save gas at every iteration.

Moreover also at the following lines i++ can be used `unchecked {i++;}` because before going overflow iteration will most probably run out of gas.

## Unused internal function to be removed
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/aec9928d8bdce8a5a4efe45f54c39d4fc7313731/contracts/contract/tokens/TokenggAVAX.sol#L255
`function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)` is not called by any contract, can be removed.
I'm aware that there are similar occurences in already known issues **[GAS-11] internal functions not called by the contract should be removed** but this function is not mentioned.
