# Summary

We list 5 low-critical findings and 1 non-critical finding:
* (low) block.timestamp is uint32 in `TokenggAVAX`
* (low) ProtocolDao.setClaimingContractPct should has reasonable check
* (low) ProtocolDAO.sol code for testing
* (low) open TODO
* (low) ERC4626Upgradeable.sol, ERC20Upgradeable.sol and BaseAbstract.sol should have storage gap
* (Non) RewardPool.startRewardsCycle doesn’t set a proper start time of the new reward cycle.

# (low) block.timestamp is uint32 in `TokenggAVAX`


## Impact

Solidity docs defined that `block.timestamp` is `uint256`, but in `TokenggAVAX`, it uses `uint32` to store timestamps. The uint32.max is 4294967295 which is `Sun Feb 07 2106`, it means that the protocol will break when the maturity is greater than 2106.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Define as uint256 or larger bits than 32.
# (low) ProtocolDao.setClaimingContractPct should has reasonable check

## Impact

`ProtocolDao.setClaimingContractPct` is used to set the percentage a contract is owed for a rewards cycle. But it doesn’t check that the total sum of percentage is 100%. 

## Proof of Concept

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/ProtocolDAO.sol#L107
```
	/// @notice Set the percentage a contract is owed for a rewards cycle
	function setClaimingContractPct(string memory claimingContract, uint256 decimal) public onlyGuardian valueNotGreaterThanOne(decimal) {
		setUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("ProtocolDAO.ClaimingContractPct.", claimingContract)), decimal);
	}
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

`setClaimingContractPct` should set the percentages of all the contracts owed for a rewards cycle. Then it can check whether the sum of percentages is 100%.


# (low) ProtocolDAO.sol code for testing

## Impact

Test code should be removed in the production environment.

## Proof of Concept

```solidity
	/// @notice Set the rewards rate for validating Avalanche's p-chain
	/// @dev Used for testing
	function setExpectedAVAXRewardsRate(uint256 rate) public onlyMultisig valueNotGreaterThanOne(rate) {
		setUint(keccak256("ProtocolDAO.ExpectedAVAXRewardsRate"), rate);
	}
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/ProtocolDAO.sol#L154-L158

## Tools Used

Manual Review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove these code.

# (low) open TODO

## Impact

These open TODO should be implemented.

## Proof of Concept

```
BaseAbstract.sol
6:// TODO remove this when dev is complete

Staking.sol
203:    // TODO cant use onlySpecificRegisteredContract("ClaimNodeOp", msg.sender) since we also call from increaseMinipoolCount. Wat do?

MinipoolManager.sol
412:            // TODO Revisit this logic if we ever allow unequal matched funds
```

## Tools Used

Manual Review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Implement these open TODO.

# (low) ERC4626Upgradeable.sol, ERC20Upgradeable.sol and BaseAbstract.sol should have storage gap

## Impact

The inherited upgradable contract should have storage gaps.

## Proof of Concept

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/BaseAbstract.sol#L11

## Tools Used

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Using storage gap:

```
    uint256[50] __gap;
```

# (Non) RewardPool.startRewardsCycle could set a proper start time of the new reward cycle.

## Impact

In `RewardPool.startRewardsCycle()`, it would start a new reward cycle and set `RewardsPool.RewardsCycleStartTime` to `block.timestamp`. It could set a start time based on the number of reward cycles that have elapsed. 
## Proof of Concept

`RewardPool.startRewardsCycle()` set `RewardsPool.RewardsCycleStartTime` to `block.timestamp`.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/RewardsPool.sol#L164
```
	function startRewardsCycle() external {
		…

		// Set start of new rewards cycle
		setUint(keccak256("RewardsPool.RewardsCycleStartTime"), block.timestamp);
		…
	}
```

According to `ProtocolDao.sol`. The length of a reward cycle is 28 days by default.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-gogopool/blob/main/contracts/contract/ProtocolDAO.sol#L33
```
		// RewardsPool
		setUint(keccak256("ProtocolDAO.RewardsCycleSeconds"), 28 days); // The time in which a claim period will span in seconds - 28 days by default
```

Thus, if the elapsed time is 55 days and you call `RewardPool.startRewardsCycle()`, only one reward cycle is counted.

## Tools Used

Manual Review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

set a proper start time of the new reward cycle.
```
	function startRewardsCycle() external {
		…

		// Set start of new rewards cycle
		ProtocolDAO dao = ProtocolDAO(getContractAddress("ProtocolDAO"));
		setUint(keccak256("RewardsPool.RewardsCycleStartTime"), getRewardsCycleStartTime() + getRewardsCyclesElapsed() * dao.getRewardsCycleSeconds());
		…
	}

```
